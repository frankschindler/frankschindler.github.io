        <h1>Mathematica</h1>
        Here you can find some Mathematica notebooks related to non-interacting fermionic topological phases. None of this is code is optimal. I tend to minimize the lifetime I spend on coding rather than the runtime a machine spends on executing. (This is arguably not an acceptable position to take in the case of problems which scale exponentially with physical system size. For the polynomial-in-system-size simulation of non-interacting electrons it is a luxury one can afford.)

    <h1>Links</h1>
    <div class="body">
        I always liked the "links" sites that people would put up as part of their personal hand-crafted websites back in the 2000s, with a collection of their favorite spots on the then burgeoning WWW. Nowadays, this has gone somewhat out of fashion, probably with the coming-of-age of search-engines to blame, or due to the same shift in culture that rid us from framesets.
        <p></p>
        In homage, I collect some links here.
