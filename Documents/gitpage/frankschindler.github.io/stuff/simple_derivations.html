    Here you can find some hacks that are meant as memory aids and for amusement, never for a replacement of the correct derivation. They require some familiarity with theoretical physics. Let me know if you have comments or further suggestions.
  <p>
    <b>1. The barometric height formula</b>
    <br>
    We want to find how air density \(\rho\) is related to height from ground \(h\) in the atmosphere. At temperature \(T\) and in the thermodynamic limit, we expect \(\rho\) to be given by the Boltzmann distribution
    $$\rho(h) \propto \exp\left\{- \frac{E(h)}{k_B T}\right\},$$
    where \(E(h)\) is the energy of particles at height \(h\) and \(k_B\) is Boltzmann's constant. When we plug in the standard potential energy formula \(E(h) = m g h\) that is valid close to earth's surface, with \(m\) the mass of air particles and \(g\) the gravitational acceleration, we retrieve the barometric height formula. <i>Note: this is somewhat suprising, since there is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometric_formula#Derivation">alternative derivation</a> that does not use statistical mechanics concepts at all.</i>

    <b>2. Radiation pressure</b>
    <br>
    We want to find the pressure \(p\) exerted by electromagnetic radiation with energy density \(\epsilon\). Assuming photons don't interact (photon-photon scattering via a Feynman box diagram is suppressed by the fourth power \(\alpha^4\) of the fine-structure constant), we may use the energy-momentum tensor \(T_{\mu \nu} = \mathrm{diag}\{\epsilon,p,p,p\}\) for an ideal gas at rest. Remembering that the stress-energy tensor of light
      $$T_{\mu \nu} \propto \frac{\delta}{\delta g^{\mu \nu}} \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \sqrt{g} F_{\alpha \beta} F^{\alpha \beta} \propto \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \sqrt{g} \left\{F_{\mu \alpha} F_{\nu}^{\hphantom{\nu}\alpha} - \frac{1}{4} g_{\mu \nu} F_{\alpha \beta} F^{\alpha \beta}\right\}$$
      is traceless in four dimensions (with \(g_{\mu \nu}\) the metric and \(F_{\alpha \beta}\) the antisymmetric Maxwell tensor), we obtain \(-\epsilon + 3 p = 0\), and thereby \(p = \epsilon/3\).
