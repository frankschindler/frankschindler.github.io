		Thank you very much for your interest in my research!
	</p>

	<p>
		To avoid frequent disruption, I usually look at my emails about once a week. I then read every email I have received, but unfortunately cannot answer all of them.

		If you are a prospective PhD student, please note that I will not have dedicated funding available for entry in 2026. While I'd be happy to consider taking on a new student, this means you would need to secure your own funding (e.g. via a <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/fees-and-funding/postgraduate-doctoral/grants-scholarships/presidents-phd/">President's PhD scholarship</a>).
