		I read every email I receive, but unfortunately I do not have the time to answer all of them. If you do not receive a reply to your application for an internship, PhD position, or postdoc position, this means that I do not have availability to supervise you.
	</p>

	<p>
		Exception: If you are a prospective PhD student, please apply via the university's official application portal, and I will be happy to look at your application there. For entry in 2026, I will not have dedicated funding available, and so you would need to secure your own funding (e.g. via a <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/fees-and-funding/postgraduate-doctoral/grants-scholarships/presidents-phd/">President's PhD scholarship</a>.)
