		Thank you very much for your interest in my research! If you would like to get in touch, please note the following:
	</p>

	<p>
		To avoid frequent disruption, I usually look at my emails only about once a week. I then read every email I have received, but unfortunately cannot answer all of them. If you have not received a reply within two weeks, please assume that I am unable to help you at this time.

		If you are a prospective PhD student, please note that I will not have dedicated funding available for entry in 2026. While I'd be happy to consider taking on one new student, this means you would need to secure your own funding (e.g. via a <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/fees-and-funding/postgraduate-doctoral/grants-scholarships/presidents-phd/">President's PhD scholarship</a>).
