	</p>

	<p>
		Thank you very much for your interest in my research!
	</p>

	<p>
		I read all emails I receive, but unfortunately cannot respond to each one. If your message concerns a potential PhD, postdoc, or internship and you do not hear back from me, please take this as an indication that I am not currently able to supervise you.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you are a prospective PhD student, please note that I will not have dedicated funding available for entry in 2026. While I'd be happy to consider taking on one new student, this means you would need to secure your own funding (e.g. via a <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/fees-and-funding/postgraduate-doctoral/grants-scholarships/presidents-phd/">President's PhD scholarship</a>).
