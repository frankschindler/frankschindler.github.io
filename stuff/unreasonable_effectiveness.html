  <p><b>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Tight-Binding Models in Condensed Matter Physics</b></p>
  <p>
  When we think of an exotic electronic phase of matter such as superconductivity, we usually think of a myriad of electrons (like 10<sup>23</sup>) that are interacting, and via their interaction give rise to seemingly magical properties like dissipation-less current flows. Implicit in our picture is the philosophically loaded notion of "emergence" that has been a basic tenet of condensed matter physics since Anderson's paper "More is different". The whole is more than the sum of its parts, and a single electron would never superconduct.
  </p>
  <p>
  In an interesting twist, many of the most recent developments in the field of topological phases can be understood entirely on the level of single-particle physics. These phases are often realized by electrons in a crystal that may hop from one atom to another, while the atoms themselves remain fixed in place. Systems of this kind, where electrons are restricted to atomic sites, and only have kinetic energy due to hopping, are called tight-binding models. The electrons in these models don't interact, but rather move through the crystal in blissfull ignorance of each other's existence. This is of course an idealization, real electrons repel and can exchange energy in other ways -- interestingly, it is an idealization that often works.

  This is good news for condensed matter physicists, since it is often too hard to solve for the coordinated behavior of many interacting particles. Tight-binding models, on the other hand, are straightforward to treat. They nevertheless lead to interesting phenomena: Next to providing an elementary description of all kinds of conventional conductors, semiconductors and insulators, they take center stage in the study of topological phases of matter. Their relevance to systems that actually exist out there in nature was brought home forcefully via the experimental confirmation of topological insulators and Weyl semimetals. And yet, there seems to be no immediate reason for why the crude approximation "there's no interaction at all" should be so successful.

  Some insight can be gleaned from a set of ideas that physicists call the "renormalization group". This incredibly profound concept deserves neither its unwieldy name nor the neglect it has suffered from so far in popular accounts of theoretical physics. The goal of this text is not to make up for this: in fact, what follows will hardly do things justice. Nevertheless, I hope to get some flavor across.

  Say you have some microscopic theory of a system, such as that of elementary electrons which interact each other and the atomic nuclei they were taken from via the exchange of photons. The renormalization group provides a precise prescription of how we can "forget" about microscopic excitations of the system. (In the end, when we measure things, we cannot resolve distances below a certain limit anyway, so it's ok to forget about what's going on there, as long as we correctly take its large-distance effects into account. This is achieved by the renormalization group formalism.) When following through with the calculations, it turns out that the excitations at long distances (call them quasi-electrons) interact only weakly, while the main effect of the microscopic interactions is to change the behavior of individual quasi-electrons away from that of elementary electrons (i.e., by changing their mass). We thus end up with a long-distance description in which it is perfectly OK to neglect interactions, as long as the individual excitations we allow for are not elementary electrons but quasi-electrons.
  </p>
  <p>
  It is worth going a bit meta here. In condensed matter, we are often confronted with complicated microscopic models that are hard to solve. One way to make progress is to forget about microscopic details and arrive at a simpler, long-distance description. This description can be very different from the original theory: we saw how it can change strongly-interacting electrons into weakly-interacting quasi-electrons. In fact, in many cases the way in which the macroscopic description differs from the microscopic one goes well beyond this. For all pratical purposes, the former is very much a theory of its own, and within the limits of its validity provides a self-contained framework for the description of natural processes. This is responsible for the great deal of variety in condensed matter physics (which should seem suprising, given that in the end it all comes down to electrons, nuclei and photons). Conversely, one might reasonably expect that these "elementary" excitations themselves just arise from a renormalization group treatment of even more fundamental degrees of freedom.

    It is sometimes stated with great pomp and wonder that simple laws can give rise to unexpected and complex behavior. The success of tight-binding models shows that the opposite may just as well be the case: Complicated microscopic interactions can give rise to simple macroscopic behavior.
  </p>
</p><i>
    A note to the experts: this account is hardly optimal. In particular, it conflates lattice tight-binding models with continuum Fermi liquid theory and may very well be at the same time too simplistic for professionals and too arcane for laymen. In any case, I feel that popular science is dominated too much by catchy topics such as black holes and quantum computers, while the beauty that lies in many aspects of condensed matter physics is not adequately appreciated. In particular, the the renormalization group as well as the notion of effective theories deserves more dissemination.
